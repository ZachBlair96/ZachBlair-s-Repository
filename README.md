# ZachBlair-s-Repository
My name is Zachariah Blair and I am a Senior at Indiana Univeristy studying Informatics with a cognate in business. I'm particularly interested in ETL(Extract Transfer Load) processes as well as creating data visualizations. Most of my experience in data visualization is within Microsoft Power Bi but I would like to expand my knowledge into other platforms such as Tableau and D3.js
